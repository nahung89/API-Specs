# *Spec Summary*
#################

- on v5, users can only chat on the VTV dance floor.

- (MUST) Text Message
// - (Nice to Have) Send Single Song
// - (That's not a priority on v5) Send Collection

- (MUST) one-on-one chat
// - (That's not a priority on v5) Group chat

// - (That's not a priority on v5) unread, already read

*People who are following each other*
- People who are following each other, can chat any number of people per day
    [!] Do you mean the number of message? Or you mean: If I have 10 followers, I can chat with all of them in a day. 

*People who are not following each other*
- (MUST) People who are not following each other can only chat five people in 24 hours
    [!] Does it mean I can start new conversation with only 5 max strangers, in 24 hours?
    [!] And what if more than 5 strangers start new conversation with me? Do we allow this case?

- (MUST) Every time user invite a friend with his invitation code, the maximum number that can be chat with people who you are not following will increase by 10
    [!] As I see in new pages, we are lacking of the function/page to identify the invitation code?
    [!] Also, we might need to notify user that he/she gains the gift: "Congratulations, you can chat with xxx new friend now!"

*Need Facebook Connect*
- (MUST) After pressing "Send" for the first time in chat
- (MUST) After pressing "Send" for the first time in the comment input field
    [!] If an user doesn't connect with FB account when send -> He/she can't send message?


- Page_1_p3
    [!] Start a new conversation -> empty ?
    [!] Already have conversation -> show content ?

- Page_1_p3 -> Page_2_p1
    [!] How does chat dialog becomes full screen? By tap on chat input?
    [!] If we tap back in Page_2_p1, the Page_1_p2 will re-appear?
    [!] To open Page_2_p1 from Page_1_p3, I suggest that we have full-screen-button on top right menu to switch between fullsceen <-> dialog, is it okay?

- Page_2, Page_3
    [!] Smile icon is using to open Gif Emojis collection (same with VTV page) ?
    [!] How to dismiss keyboard: scroll up/down in message area? 
    [!] How many max characters do we allow in message?

- Page_6 (assume that I send message to Zebbie)
    [!] The purple view only shows up if I send message to Zebbie? Otherwise it's empty as Page_1_p3?
    [!] Do I allow to send another message, or only one message to get the request?
    [!] I don't see the keyboard in 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, does it mean I only send 1 message and have to wait for approval from Zebbie to send more?
    [!] The purple area will stay remaining, no matter Zebbie approves or rejects the request? And later even we chat a lot?
    [!] The UI of purple area make me feel a dating app. Besides, I'm considering the case people just want to make friends (guy/guy, girl/girl..).

- Page_7 (assume that Zebbie send me a request)
    [!] How Page_7_p1 appear when I'm in VTV page? And what happen if I have more than 1 invitation?
    [!] If I reject the request, the chat between Zebbie and me won't appear in p2?

- Page_8
    [!] What is the 'Today' label on top mean?
    [!] Group continous messages could take times, pls consider the case that we seperate messages into individual rows (like https://zpl.io/bz84xkz).

- Page_7, Page_8
    [!] In case I have a lot of conversations, and I will have to switch between p2, p3a, p3b -> Everytime I get in a chat, it always appear a dialog and I have to enter full screen. From this point, it could be an uncomfortable UX.
    [!] Is it okay if we put the the popup in p1 into a small view in p3a (under the messages)? It might be better when user gets a lot of requests.

- Page_9
    [!] Does p1 only appear when I send 1st messsage on VIBBIDI, and won't show incase I reinstall app (with Fb connected before)?
    [!] And if I tap close in p1 (without connect Facebook) -> Stay in Page_2, Page_3, Page_4, Page_5 without sending message?
    [!] How does the invitation code work in our app?
